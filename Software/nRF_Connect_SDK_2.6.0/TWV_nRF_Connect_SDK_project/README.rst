Project Basics

Project title: TRUE WIRELESS VALVE

Project teaser: A battery-powered, Home Assistant-compatible valve for effortless, smart water control in your home.

Effortless Installation: One of the TWV's features is its user-friendly installation process. The version equipped with a clamp is especially convenient, as it can be attached directly to your existing plumbing setup without the need for a plumber or the hassle of removing the current valve. This design not only simplifies the installation process but also retains the manual functionality of your valve. You can operate the TWV using its handle just like a traditional valve with feedback to Home Assistant, offering a seamless blend of manual and smart control.

True Wireless Convenience: The TWV shows the power of wireless technology. Being battery-powered, it eliminates the need for any additional wiring, offering a true wireless solution that integrates effortlessly into your home environment. This design not only makes installation easier but also ensures safety, as there's no risk associated with high-voltage connections.

Smart Home Integration: Specifically designed with Home Assistant users in mind (ZHA), at the same time TWV also supports Zigbee2MQTT, ensuring seamless integration into your existing smart home ecosystem. It excels in providing real-time feedback, displaying the current status of the valve, whether you operate it manually or through the web interface.
